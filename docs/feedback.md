It's awesome! You did an awesome job!

- Vmock is a good resource to help upgrade the resume.
- I think the actual site (the page that the link on Github leads you to) had trouble and had combined your skills section and overlapped it onto other text.
- The section about 'Chemical Transport Assistant' might need some revision. Not sure if you just hadnt finished the sentence.
